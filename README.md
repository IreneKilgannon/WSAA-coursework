# Web Services and Applications


This is my repository for the semester three module, Web Services and Applications for a [Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics](https://www.atu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-science-data-analytics) at the [Atlantic Technological University](https://www.atu.ie/).

The repository contains three directories:
    * labs
    * assignments

## labs

This directory contains the lab work that accompanies the weekly lectures.

## assignments

This directory contains the assignments that make up 40% of the overall mark for this module. 

This directory contains the following assignments:

* assignment2-carddraw.ipynb
    * Using this API, [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/) write a program that prints out five cards. 

    This API simulates dealing a deck of cards. First the cards are shuffled, then five cards are drawn and the 
    value and suit of each card printed.

* assignment03-cso.py
    * Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "Exchequer Account (Historical Series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json". 


## wsaa-project

This directory will contain a large project that will be set in week 7 or week 8.

This project will be an application that:
    * Retrieves data from and interacts with an API in the cloud
    * Creates and consumes your own API
    * Does something you decide
